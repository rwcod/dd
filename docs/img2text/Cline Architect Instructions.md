# Cline Architect Instructions - Image-to-Text

This document outlines the recommended approach for the **Architect** role, focusing on high-level solution design, tooling decisions, and strategic planning for the Dockerized AI Image-to-Text project.

---

## 1. Requirements Analysis
1. **Docker Isolation**  
   Each AI task should run within a Docker container for portability and consistency.
2. **MongoDB Integration**  
   Retrieve image data and model configurations; log text results back to MongoDB.
3. **Callback Mechanism**  
   Optionally provide an HTTP endpoint to signal completion (via POST).
4. **Pretrained Model**  
   Use a reliable image-captioning framework (e.g., BLIP, Show-and-Tell, or other Vision-Language model).
5. **Scalability**  
   Large batches of images may need GPU acceleration or concurrency strategies.

## 2. System Architecture
1. **Containerization**  
   - Create a Dockerfile that includes Python dependencies, GPU drivers (if needed), and model weights.
2. **Data Flow**  
   - MongoDB provides dataset records (or references) to images.
   - The AI model processes each image, generating a text description or caption.
   - MongoDB is updated with result metadata (e.g., text caption).
   - An optional callback is triggered on completion.
3. **Configuration Management**  
   - Store sensitive credentials in environment variables.
   - Use dedicated config files or environment variables for Docker.
4. **Security & Networking**  
   - Restrict container access to only necessary external services.
   - Store secrets securely (environment variables, vault, etc.).
5. **Scalability & Future Updates**  
   - Plan for large-scale image processing, parallel inference, or streaming.
   - Maintain version control for model artifacts and Docker images.

## 3. Technology & Tooling
1. **Python** (using PyTorch and Transformers)  
2. **Docker** for containerization  
3. **MongoDB** (via `pymongo`)  
4. **Pretrained Image Captioning** model (BLIP via Hugging Face Transformers)

---

## 4. Implementation Strategy
1. **Prototyping**  
   - Validate local environment and ensure model loads correctly.
2. **Dockerization**  
   - Build a Docker image containing all dependencies (model, libraries, etc.).
3. **CI/CD** (Optional)  
   - Configure automated builds and tests (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins).
4. **Version Control**  
   - Use a branching strategy (e.g., GitFlow).
5. **Performance Tuning**  
   - Consider GPU acceleration, concurrency, caching partial inferences.
