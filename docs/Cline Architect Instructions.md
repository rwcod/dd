Cline Architect Instructions
Purpose
This document outlines the recommended approach for the Architect role, focusing on high-level solution design, tooling decisions, and strategic planning for the Dockerized AI Text-to-Image project.

1. Requirements Analysis
Docker Isolation
Each AI task runs in a Docker container for portability and consistency.

MongoDB Integration
Retrieve datasets and model configurations from MongoDB; log results back to MongoDB.

Google Cloud Storage
Store generated image files in GCS.

Callback Mechanism
Optionally provide an HTTP endpoint to signal completion (via POST).

Pretrained Model
Use Stable Diffusion or an equivalent model to handle text-to-image generation.

2. System Architecture
Containerization

Create a Dockerfile that includes Python dependencies, GPU drivers (if needed), and model weights.
Data Flow

MongoDB supplies dataset records and model configurations.
The AI model processes text prompts into images.
Images are then uploaded to GCS.
MongoDB is updated with result metadata (including GCS URLs).
An optional callback is triggered upon completion.
Configuration Management

Store sensitive credentials (e.g., GCS keys) in environment variables.
Use dedicated config files or environment variables within Docker.
Security & Networking

Restrict container access to only necessary external services.
Store secrets in a secure vault or as environment variables.
Scalability & Future Updates

Plan for other AI tasks in the future (video, audio, NLP, etc.).
Maintain version control for model artifacts and Docker images.
3. Technology & Tooling
Stable Diffusion or an equivalent text-to-image model.
Python (using PyTorch or TensorFlow, depending on the chosen model).
Docker for containerization.
Google Cloud Storage (via google-cloud-storage Python library).
MongoDB (via pymongo Python driver).
4. Implementation Strategy
Prototyping

Validate the local environment using sample data.
Test loading the model, generating images, and uploading to GCS.
Dockerization

Build a Docker image with all dependencies.
Include GPU drivers if hardware acceleration is required.
CI/CD (Optional)

Configure automated builds and tests using a platform like GitLab CI, GitHub Actions, or Jenkins.
Version Control

Employ a branching strategy (e.g., GitFlow) to manage features and releases effectively.
Performance Tuning

Consider GPU acceleration, concurrency (multi-threading, multi-processing), caching of partial results.
